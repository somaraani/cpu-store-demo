# cpu-store-demo
A sample project for a CPU store with a PHP Backend, and Angular Front-End. 

This application consists of 3 parts, and they are all dockerized. You can bring up all 3 by running 

```
docker-compose up 
``` 
In the root directory (where the `docker-compose.yml`) file is. This should start everything up, and you can go to 

```
http://localhost:8888
```
In order to use the app.
